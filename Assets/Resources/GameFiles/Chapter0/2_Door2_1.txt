What did you find?
Speaker Reko/Angry
They just left a damn gun lying around! Do they expect us to use this for something?
Wait a second, this gun's empty?! I guess it can't be used for much then.
Do you want it?
Speaker Protag_[None]
Me? You're just going to give something like that to somebody you've never met?
Speaker Reko/Angry
Well, yeah. It's useless to me, so I guess you can have it. It's not like you're gonna do much harm without any bullets.
Besides, I'm stronger than I look, and I won't go down without a fight, so don't try anything.

That's weird. There's a massive hole in the center of this gun.
