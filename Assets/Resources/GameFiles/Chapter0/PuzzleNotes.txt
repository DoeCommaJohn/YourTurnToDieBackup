Overview
Line 1: PuzzleArea
Line 2: Either DebugMode or the starting room
There will be multiple groupings, each with the following
XA) Room name: this will not be seen by the player, but helps with internal organization
XB) Background
XC) List of each interactable object, listed with a pair of dimensions, with the lower left and upper right pixel coordinates
X	Pixel coordinates make it easier for an art person looking at the image to adjust, rather than requiring a programmer
D) Each button will need some sort of result: the possible results are:
	Popup, but nothing else
	Move to a different room
	Dialogue/Popup, then receive an item, possibly followed by more dialogue
	Dialogue/Popup, including a dialogue option
		Note: this dialogue option may include prompting for an item.
E) Each room will have a list of neighbors which can be traveled to.
	Occasionally neighbors will have restrictions preventing access
Line n: There must be a clear condition for the section

Items
	Can be combined with other items
	Items are only used when the game prompts, so I don't need to worry about a player trying every item on a button
	The player may start off with weapons
